Welcome to BudgetBuddy, where cookies aren't just for snacking - they're also for tracking!

🍪 Here at BudgetBuddy, we believe in transparency, even when it comes to cookies. So, let's talk
about the cookies we use and why they're sweeter than your grandma's secret recipe.

🍪 Chocolate Chip Cookies: These little nuggets of joy help us understand how you use our website
so we can make it even better. Plus, they're perfect for dunking in milk while we crunch those numbers!

🍪 Peanut Butter Cookies: Just like peanut butter and jelly, these cookies stick around to remember
your preferences. Whether you're a crunchy or creamy kind of person, we've got you covered.

🍪 Oatmeal Raisin Cookies: Some call them controversial, but we call them misunderstood. These
cookies help us analyze website traffic and figure out what pages are raisin' the roof!

But don't worry, we're not storing your secrets in a cookie jar. Your privacy is as important
to us as finding that last chocolate chip in the bag. We'll never use cookies to identify you personally -
unless you're Cookie Monster, in which case, hi there! 🍪👋

By continuing to browse our site, you're consenting to the use of these delicious cookies.
If you prefer to stick to real cookies, we totally understand - just know that you might
miss out on some of the magic that makes BudgetBuddy so sweet!

Thanks for indulging in our cookie policy. Now go ahead, treat yourself to a real cookie
while you manage your finances like a boss! 🍪💼
